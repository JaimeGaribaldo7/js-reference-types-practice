create an array for each line with what stops it has
define each line

Create a function in lib/mbta.js to calculate the number of stops between stations on the "MBTA". Write additional functions used by this function as needed.
The function takes the line and stop that a rider is getting on at and the line and stop that a rider is getting off at and returns the total number of stops for the trip.

make a function that recieves the stop you get on, and

im going ot Boston,
the route has 10 stops
the bus stop at stop&shop is where i get on
this stop is the first stop
we pass every stop on the way to the Train stations
the train station is stop number 10
from stop 10 i take a different route with 10 stops
the traim station is the 3rd stop of the 10.
i get off on the 10th station
take the stop you start on and the stop you end with and find the difference.
